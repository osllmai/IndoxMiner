    "In this cell, the `Extractor` instance processes the previously prepared document data (`data`) to extract specific fields as defined by the schema. The extracted data is then converted into a DataFrame format for easier analysis and manipulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Steps Explained:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Data Extraction**: `extracted_data = extractor.extract(data)`  \n",
    "   - The `extract` method is called on the `extractor` instance, passing in `data` (the processed document data).\n",
    "   - This method applies the specified schema to `data`, extracting fields according to the schema definitions (e.g., fields from `Schema.Invoice`).\n",
    "   - The resulting `extracted_data` contains the structured, schema-aligned information.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Conversion to DataFrame**: `extracted_data_df = extractor.to_dataframe(extracted_data)`  \n",
    "   - The `to_dataframe` method converts `extracted_data` into a DataFrame format.\n",
    "   - This structured format makes it easy to view, analyze, and manipulate the data using DataFrame operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Display the DataFrame**: `extracted_data_df`  \n",
    "   - Displaying `extracted_data_df` shows the extracted data in a tabular form.\n",
    "   - This final output allows for easy inspection of the extracted fields across multiple documents, facilitating analysis or further processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "By converting to a DataFrame, the extracted information is organized in a format that is convenient for downstream tasks such as visualization, reporting, or exporting to other formats (e.g., CSV, Excel).\n"
