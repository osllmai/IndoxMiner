    "# Passport Data Extraction Using Indox and OCR\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will demonstrate how to extract structured data from passport images using the Indox API and Optical Character Recognition (OCR) techniques. The primary focus will be on processing the images and extracting relevant data fields from them, allowing us to automate the extraction of critical information typically found in passports.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview of IndoxMiner\n",
    "\n",
    "**IndoxMiner** is a powerful document processing and data extraction tool designed to streamline the process of converting unstructured document data into structured, usable information. Key features of IndoxMiner include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Schema-Based Extraction**: Allows users to define custom extraction schemas for various document types (e.g., invoices, passports, flight tickets), enabling tailored data extraction that meets specific requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Validation Rules**: Supports the application of validation rules on extracted data to ensure data integrity and accuracy. Users can define patterns and constraints that extracted fields must adhere to.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Multi-Model Support**: Offers integration with multiple OCR models, such as Tesseract, EasyOCR, and PaddleOCR, allowing users to select the most suitable model for their specific needs.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **OpenAI Integration**: Leverages OpenAI's language models to enhance document understanding and improve extraction quality, particularly for complex or poorly structured documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Output Formats**: Provides flexibility in output formats, enabling extracted data to be saved in various formats such as JSON, CSV, or directly into DataFrames for further analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Efficient Document Processing**: The DocumentProcessor class manages the lifecycle of document processing, including reading, pre-processing, and applying OCR, ensuring an efficient workflow from raw documents to structured data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **User-Friendly API**: Simplifies interaction with complex machine learning models and OCR tools through a user-friendly API, making it accessible for users with varying levels of technical expertise.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we begin, we need to install the necessary libraries that will be used in this demonstration. If you are using Google Colab, you can install them using the commands below (uncomment the lines if needed).\n",

    "## Import Necessary Libraries\n",
    "Now, let’s import the necessary libraries required for our task. Each library plays a specific role in the workflow:\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **os**: Provides a way to interact with the operating system, allowing us to read and manipulate file paths.\n",
    "*   **cv2**: Part of OpenCV, a computer vision library that enables image processing tasks such as reading images, resizing, and applying filters.\n",
    "*   **gc**: The garbage collection module that helps in managing memory usage by cleaning up unreferenced objects in Python.\n",
    "*   **pandas**: A data manipulation library that provides powerful data structures like DataFrames, making it easier to handle and analyze structured data.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Core Components of IndoxMiner\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. NerdToken API\n",
    "   - **Description**: NerdToken API offers a model designed to work with real-time data extraction in specialized document formats.\n",
    "   - **Best For**: Real-time or streaming tasks where data extraction needs to be as efficient as possible.\n",
    "   - **Features**:\n",
    "      - Advanced **temperature, frequency, and presence penalties** for tailored responses.\n",
    "      - Optimized for quick setup and results.\n",
    "   - **Usage**: Suited for specialized applications requiring low latency and immediate data retrieval.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. DocumentProcessor\n",
    "The **DocumentProcessor** class is responsible for managing the workflow of document processing. This includes reading the documents, applying Optical Character Recognition (OCR), and preparing the extracted text for further processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Key Features**:\n",
    "  - **Document Handling**: Capable of processing various document formats, including images and PDFs, ensuring versatility in handling input sources.\n",
    "  - **Pre-processing Capabilities**: Includes methods to pre-process documents (e.g., resizing, filtering), which can improve OCR accuracy and the quality of extracted data.\n",
    "  - **Batch Processing**: Supports processing multiple documents in a single operation, optimizing efficiency when dealing with large datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. ProcessingConfig\n",
    "The **ProcessingConfig** class provides configuration options for customizing the document processing and extraction pipeline. This allows users to specify parameters relevant to the OCR process and data extraction.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Key Features**:\n",
    "  - **OCR Model Selection**: Users can choose from different OCR models (e.g., PaddleOCR, Tesseract, EasyOCR) based on their specific requirements.\n",
    "  - **Image Preprocessing Options**: Enables configurations related to image handling, such as resolution adjustments, image formats, and processing methods.\n",
    "  - **Fine-tuning for Accuracy**: Users can tweak settings to optimize the OCR process for specific document types or to accommodate varying quality levels in the source documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Schema\n",
    "The **Schema** class defines the structure of the data to be extracted from documents. It specifies the fields to be extracted, along with their types and any associated validation rules.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Key Features**:\n",
    "  - **Predefined Schemas**: Offers several built-in schemas tailored for common document types (e.g., passports, invoices, flight tickets), streamlining the extraction process.\n",
    "  - **Custom Schema Definition**: Users can create their own schemas by specifying field names, descriptions, and types, allowing for flexibility to accommodate unique document formats.\n",
    "  - **Field Validation**: Integrates validation rules to ensure that the extracted data meets specific criteria (e.g., regex patterns), enhancing data quality.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Extractor\n",
    "The **Extractor** class is the primary component responsible for executing the data extraction process based on the defined schema. It takes the processed document data and applies the extraction logic to retrieve structured information.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Key Features**:\n",
    "  - **Schema-Driven Extraction**: Uses the provided schema to guide the extraction process, ensuring that the right fields are captured from the processed documents.\n",
    "  - **Data Structuring**: Converts the raw extracted text into structured data formats, making it easier to analyze and manipulate.\n",
    "  - **Output Conversion**: Provides methods to convert extracted data into various formats, such as Pandas DataFrames, JSON, or CSV, facilitating downstream data processing tasks.\n"

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "In this demo, we successfully extracted structured data from passport images using the Indox API and OCR techniques. This process automates the retrieval of critical information typically found in passports, such as passport number, name, date of birth, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Future Work\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider enhancing this demo by adding error handling for OCR failures, integrating logging for better traceability, or extending the extraction schema for additional fields. You can also explore using a different OCR model to compare performance and accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Additional Features of IndoxMiner\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Dynamic Schema Adaptation**: Users can define and adapt schemas dynamically, allowing for easy adjustments to the data extraction process as document formats change.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Comprehensive Documentation**: IndoxMiner comes with thorough documentation that helps users understand how to implement features, troubleshoot issues, and optimize their extraction processes.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Community Support**: As an open-source project, IndoxMiner benefits from community contributions and support, enabling continuous improvement and feature enhancement.\n",
